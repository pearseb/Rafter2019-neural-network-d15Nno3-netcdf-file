The python code here takes the .txt file and converts the 1D ASCII data into a 3D gridded netcdf file.

For this to work, you must download the woa13_all_n00_01.nc file from https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/OC5/woa13/woa13oxnu.pl

Also, some dependencies in the python (version 3.7) environment are required:
	- numpy
	- netCDF4
